# siggen
Siggen was written by David Radford and original version can be found here:

The point is that, I wanted to run siggen in python and windows area and alittle bit make it faster, that is why came up with this solution.

I translatED code to C++ and used PYBIND11_MODULE to run in python (in any environemnt).

To run you need to type "python run_mjd_fieldgen.py"
